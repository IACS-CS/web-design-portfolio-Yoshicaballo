        <h2>My Business Card Project</h2>
        <p>
          This second project incorporated design layouts with two styles of cards: a standard box model card and a flex box model card, to create two appealing business cards. The former uses margins to position HTML elements while the latter uses flex-styles to position them. Due to the box model using margins, I made each business card about Marge Simpson.

        <h2>My Zen Garden</h2>
        <p>
          This project is all about creating a menu with purely CSS, learning about typography and CRAP (Contrast, repition, alignment and proximity)

        <h2>My Interactive Design</h2>
        <p>
          This final project incorporated every coding language web pages utilize: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I made it about SpongeBob SquarePants. It is a quiz to see if the user is a true fan of the sea sponge.

        <h2>Sources &amp; Attribution</h2>
        <p>
          Fix me... you can add a list of sources you used to create your
          portfolio here. Be sure to acknowledge any images, fonts, or other
          media you used that you did not create yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, remember if you use AI to help (including Copilot), you
          must acknowledge it here with a description of how you used AI &mdash;
          you can list tasks AI helped you with, and you should also include
          notes <em>in your source code</em> describing any AI-generated code.

        <h2>My Choose-Your-Own Adventure Project</h2>
        <p>
          The very first major project in my web design class. Requiring a minimum of eight pages, which are essentially the paths for this project, it taught how to link and reference other pages.

        <h2>My Business Card Project</h2>
        <p>
          This second project incorporated design layouts with two styles of cards: a standard box model card and a flex box model card, to create two appealing business cards. The former uses margins to position HTML elements while the latter uses flex-styles to position them. Due to the box model using margins, I made each business card about Marge Simpson.

        <h2>My Interactive Design</h2>
        <p>
          This final project incorporated every coding language web pages utilize: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I made it about SpongeBob SquarePants. It is a quiz to see if the user is a true fan of the sea sponge.
